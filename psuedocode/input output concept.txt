Heres some psuedocode of what I can do

What I can do is send different sounds to different locations as I please
By taking in different Inputs i can apply them to different channels
I can then take those channels and send them to different outputs

Likewise I can send different inputs to different outputs


So initially what I can do is send different inputs to different outputs

And make it so that a single output can take multiple inputs
And one input can go to multiple outputs

I'm trying to visualize it the best i can
